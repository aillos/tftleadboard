This repository is for the web application or website; TFT Leaderboard.
The website is for me and my friends to track our Teamfight Tactics progress and compare our rank to eachother.
The data is being fetched from the Riot Games API and stored in an SQL Database using Azure. I am using Azure Web App Hosting and Github Pages to run and deploy my application.
